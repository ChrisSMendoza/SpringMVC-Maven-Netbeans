SpringMVC-Maven-Netbeans
========================

Currently changing the README to test ngrok connection.
It didn't work the first time...
This is the second one, from an actual push

I believe the url was wrong this whole time..

It was, now comes the Jenkins part!
I uninstalled and reinstalled because I forgot my password.

Jenkins cross site security is out the window, let's try again.
Just watched a youtube tutorial do it exactly this way.


/payload/ wasn't found, but /github-webhook was found, strange?

Not strange, Jenkins has that as the default endpoint, needed a '/' at the end though

Jenkins just built it because of these changes. Let's see if it works after my computer was put to sleep.
